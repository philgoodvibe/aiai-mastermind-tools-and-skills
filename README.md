# AiAi Mastermind — Tools & Skills

A public collection of shareable [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) for Claude Code (and other agents like Codex, Gemini, Aider, Cursor). Drop them into your agent and go.

## Skills

### 🧠 [`wiki-llm`](skills/wiki-llm) — build a compounding knowledge wiki from your documents

Turn a folder of source documents (books, PDFs, papers, articles, transcripts) into a **persistent, interlinked Obsidian knowledge base maintained by an LLM** — the opposite of RAG. The LLM reads each source once and *compiles* it into cross-referenced markdown pages that sit between you and the raw sources, so the synthesis and contradictions are already there and the wiki gets richer with every source you add.

Implements [Andrej Karpathy's `llm-wiki` idea](https://gist.github.com/karpathy/442a6bf555914893e9891c11519de94f). Domain-agnostic — works for research, a company knowledge base, a single book, a hobby deep-dive, or a business.

It ships with:
- the three-layer **RAW → WIKI → OUTPUT** architecture and the hard extraction-vs-editorial boundary,
- a domain-agnostic schema template (`CLAUDE.md.template`) + five page templates (source / author / concept / framework / synthesis),
- ready-to-drop `.obsidian/` config — graph color groups, properties, and a CSS snippet that color-codes page types in note view,
- the **parallel-ingestion fan-out pattern** for ingesting dozens of sources at once,
- the **raw-traceback protocol** (page-cited quotes that trace back to the original file).

### 🖼️ [`gpt-image`](skills/gpt-image) — generate images from Claude Code using your ChatGPT subscription (no API key)

Let Claude Code create images (hero shots, product mockups, illustrations, icons, textures) by delegating to **Codex CLI's built-in `image_gen` tool** over your **ChatGPT OAuth login** — no `OPENAI_API_KEY`, no per-image API billing. The core insight: a ChatGPT OAuth token is *not* an API key (the Images API returns `401 missing scope` on it), so the skill routes every request through Codex's built-in tool instead of the API.

It enforces the things that are easy to get wrong:
- **OAuth, not API** — built-in `image_gen` via the signed-in ChatGPT session, never a raw API call.
- **One copy on disk** — `mv` (never `cp`) each output out of Codex's cache, so generated images never silently duplicate.
- absolute output paths, one call per image, a network-enabled sandbox, and a fill-in-the-blanks brief template for any use case.

Auto-triggers on "generate / create / make an image"; also ships an optional `/gpt-image` slash command. Requires the Codex CLI installed and signed in to ChatGPT.

### 📸 [`generate-me`](skills/generate-me), generate images of yourself while preserving your real facial identity

A **blank, personalizable template** for generating images of the skill owner across photoreal, illustrated, cartoon, cinematic and stylized scenes. It intentionally ships with no photos and no personal details. Point Claude Code, Codex or another coding agent at it, and the agent customizes it for the member: it sorts about five photos into identity slots, writes an identity profile from what it observes, runs a test image and grades it. Setup takes about fifteen minutes.

It ships with:
- three generation paths: an OpenAI image model through the model-router, a Google Gemini image model through the same router, and the Codex CLI built-in image tool as a fallback when no router is available,
- a bundled health check that reports which generation paths are available,
- parallel router generation that sends the same prompt to both image models at the same time, producing two versions to compare without running them one after another,
- a fully agent-runnable setup with step-by-step instructions in [`SETUP.md`](skills/generate-me/SETUP.md).

### 🔀 [`model-router`](skills/model-router) — run Claude Code builds on the subscriptions you already pay for

Adds a local "switchboard" ([CLIProxyAPI](https://github.com/router-for-me/CLIProxyAPI)) that holds your OTHER subscription logins — ChatGPT, Gemini, Grok, Kimi — so Claude Code can send work to those models with **no API keys and no per-token bills**. Repackages the [RoboNuggets model-router plugin](https://github.com/robonuggets/model-router) (CC BY 4.0) with a one-command installer.

What you get after install:
- **`/fabsol <brief>`** — the flagship flow: Claude plans, specs, and verifies while GPT-5.6 Sol does 100% of the building (≈33% cheaper than Claude building alone in the upstream benchmark),
- **`/sol <task>`** — one-shot any task on the routed model from inside a normal Claude session,
- **`/codex-usage`** — your ChatGPT/Codex weekly limit bars (percent used, reset times) without leaving Claude Code,
- **SolFab** — the reverse direction: say `solfab: <brief>` in Codex (ChatGPT app / VSCode) and it hands the brief to Claude, which orchestrates while Sol builds — remote build dispatch from your phone,
- full routed sessions via `scripts/session.sh` / `scripts/vscode.sh`.

Your Claude login never touches the proxy (that keeps you inside Anthropic's terms), and all logins stay on your machine. Setup is agent-runnable: see the install prompt below.

## Install

**Tip:** You can grab a single skill folder instead of cloning the whole repository:

```bash
curl -L https://github.com/philgoodvibe/aiai-mastermind-tools-and-skills/archive/refs/heads/main.tar.gz | tar -xz --strip-components=2 '*/skills/generate-me'
```

Swap the skill name at the end of that command to grab any skill in this repository.

**Claude Code** (personal skills):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/philgoodvibe/aiai-mastermind-tools-and-skills.git

# wiki-llm
cp -R aiai-mastermind-tools-and-skills/skills/wiki-llm ~/.claude/skills/wiki-llm

# gpt-image (+ optional /gpt-image slash command)
cp -R aiai-mastermind-tools-and-skills/skills/gpt-image ~/.claude/skills/gpt-image
cp aiai-mastermind-tools-and-skills/skills/gpt-image/gpt-image.command.md ~/.claude/commands/gpt-image.md

# generate-me
cp -R aiai-mastermind-tools-and-skills/skills/generate-me ~/.claude/skills/generate-me
```

Then just ask: *"build a wiki LLM from these PDFs"* or *"generate a hero image of …"* and the matching skill activates. (`gpt-image` needs the Codex CLI installed and signed in to ChatGPT via `codex login`.)

**Other agents:** copy the skill folder into your agent's skills directory (e.g. `~/.agents/skills/` for Codex), or point your agent at `skills/wiki-llm/SKILL.md`.

**model-router** is a full setup, not a copy-paste skill — paste this into Claude Code and it does the rest (one browser sign-in needed):

```
Clone https://github.com/philgoodvibe/aiai-mastermind-tools-and-skills and follow
skills/model-router/INSTALL.md to set up FabSol. Do every step yourself, and tell
me when you need me to approve the browser sign-in.
```

## Starter kits

### `maya-starter/` - Your Automated Social Media Content Team

The complete starter kit for the AIAI Mastermind course "Your Automated Social Media Content Team". It sets up MAYA, the AI agent that runs your content team, with Codex as the copywriter and designer she manages.

Includes: MAYA's standing instructions (CLAUDE.md), a fill-in-the-blanks job description brief, a compliance knowledge-base template, three content-lane skills (newsjacking, problem-solution, entertain), a compliance-check skill, a Mai Marketing Machine posting skill, an image and brand skill, and the brain folder where your My Agency Context document lives.

Setup (covered step by step in the course):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/philgoodvibe/aiai-mastermind-tools-and-skills.git
cp -R aiai-mastermind-tools-and-skills/maya-starter ~/Documents/your-agency-content-team
```

Then open the folder in VS Code, drop your `My_Agency_Context.md` into `brain/`, and follow `JOB-DESCRIPTION.md`.
